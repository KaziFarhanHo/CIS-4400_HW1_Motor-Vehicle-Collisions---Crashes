2) Explanation of the Data (where does it come from):
The data originates from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The source of this data is the MV-104AN form, a New York State form completed by police officers for vehicle collisions. This form is required for collisions involving injury or death, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage. The introduction of the FORMS system in March 2016 allowed for electronic entry of all MV-104AN data fields, facilitating detailed traffic safety analyses.
